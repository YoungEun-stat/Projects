Abstract

Network analysis became an crucial part of researches nowadays. The main difference
of network analysis from other methods, such as CNN and RNN, is that
it takes connectivity between nodes into consideration. In other words, the model
utilizes both nodesâ€™ features and information of their neighbors. The two typical
models for network analysis are Graph Convolutional Network(GCN) and Graph
Attention Network(GAT). The major difference between the two is that GCN utilizes
degrees as Iights, while GAT uses attention coefficient and masking to sort
out neigboring nodes. In this paper, I discuss how these models work and apply
them to actual Facebook data with four communities provided by SNAP. I compare
performances of node classification with the two model and present visualizations
with t-SNE plot to show the result visually.
